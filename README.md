# Modern-Georgian-Morphological-Data-Extended

Extension of the Georgian dataset, including variable objects.

In Georgian, one can say "you were waiting for me" in a single word. With the previous dataset, one could say only verb forms with 3rd person singular object, i.e. verbs like "we were waiting for him". In this dataset, we extend the paradigms to include all the possible objects.

Note: we decided to ignore Animacy restrictions, except when it was impossible to inflect the verbs. One can find such verbs mostly at the Indirect verbs folder. 

The features order is
"V;[Subject_features];[Object_features];[Screeve]"
